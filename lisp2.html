Trying to understand, why there are different namespaces for functions
and values in Lisp<sub>2</sub>, I was diving into that a little bit, taking some
notes and preparing a set of macros. Providing local namespaces for
the development of further macros, they can help to prevent unwanted
free name capture.

<h2 id="org3d061b6">Macro expansion and local functions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3d061b6">
<p>
When diving into that topic, you eventually stumble upon [Gabriel,
Pitman: Technical Issues of Separation in Function Cells and Value
Cells, Lisp and Symbolic Computation, Vol 1 No 1, June 1988, pp.
81-101]. According to that paper, among others a prime reason for two
separate namespaces is the existence of macros, as expressed in the
well known citation taken from there: "a single namespace is of
fundamental importance, and therefore macros are problematic [&#x2026; but]
macros are fundamental, and therefore a single namespace is
problematic".
</p>

<p>
So which problem with macros is solved by different namespaces? When
accidentally naming a local variable the same as a global function,
with a single namespace this would hide the global function. While not
being encouraged at all, name clashes could be resolved within a local
environment without refactoring the variable names. If the function was not
addressed within the environment, the fact that it is hidden wouldn't
lead to an erraneous result when evaluating the environment's forms.
But this would work only as long as no macros are used. As macros can
expand arbitrary code into the environment, this prerequisite can not
be checked.
</p>

<p>
To solve this problem with name collisions in macro expansions, the
following aspects need to be handled. For variable names of
let-environments within the macro expansion, it is typically handled
by creating uninterned anonymouns symbols (by means of <code>gensym</code>)
replacing them. This way, for variables, effectively a local namespace
is created only visible within the macro expansion. Next, local variable
names of the environment can't be addressed from the macro expansion
as long as they can't be known in the macro definition. So addressing
an arbitrary value symbol from within macro expansion would be an error, if
that name was not communicated somehow.
</p>

<p>
Stays the question of function names being addressed from the macro.
Here, in accordance to the previous statement, the set of global
functions can be seen as being communicated. So macros can expect to
address global function names regardless of the local environment they
are expanded into. To make this work, the problem mentioned above
would be mitigated by using a common function namespace shared between
the place the macro is defined in and environments it is expanded
into. Given that, macros can expect function names addressed in their
definition to be valid also in the places they are expanded into.
</p>

<p>
But in the paper mentioned above, an example is given also
showing name collisions in function namespace. It is repeated
here, slightly adopted to emacs lisp:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="org80d64a0">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (x y) `(cons 'foo (cons ,x (cons ,y nil))))

(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span> (x y)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cl-flet</span> ((cons (x y) (cons y x)))
    (foo x y)))

(baz 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Which results in an output probably not intended by the macro author:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">(((nil . 2) . 1) . foo)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This could be solved within the macro by replacing the function symbol
<code>cons</code> by it's function object valid when the macro was defined instead
of resolving it in the place of it's expansion:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="orgf348b3f">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (x y)
  `(funcall ,(symbol-function 'cons) 'foo
            (funcall ,(symbol-function 'cons) ,x
                     (funcall ,(symbol-function 'cons) ,y nil))))

(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span> (x y)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cl-flet</span> ((cons (x y) (cons y x)))
    (foo x y)))

(baz 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Which now gives the result probably intended:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">(foo 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But now, the <code>funcall</code> function name is still subject to possible free
name capture.
The paper's section concludes: "With the advent of FLET, LABELS, and
MACROLET, the risk of conflict is considerably higher".
</p>

<p>
What's done here manually to solve the conflict is similar to the
solution of hygienic macros, resolving free symbols in the lexical
context of macro definitions. But maybe this actually was not
intended by the macro. After all, it is a valid use case to replace
certain functions at runtime by different implementations, which
should be respected globally and also by macro expansions.
</p>

<p>
In [Hoyte, Doug: Let over Lambda, 2008, lulu.com], Hoyte concludes,
"Hygienic macros are, in the best of situations, a beginner's safety
guard-rail; in the worst of situations they form an electric fence,
trapping their victims in a sanitised, capture-safe prison".
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4220a70" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4220a70">Creating a local function namespace</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4220a70">
<p>
The considerations shown above give a strong hint that a common global function
namespace is expected to exist, having the properties of being shared
between all global parts of a running system and still being
dynamically modifyable (within boundaries) while staying in a
consistent state.
</p>

<p>
So an alternate approach would be not to fix the error within the macro
definition, but instead in the local function definition. As local variable
names are expected to not being hidden by macro expansions&#x2014;and
consequently, laying the responsibility of not doing that into the
definition of macros, the same could also be done for local function
names. But here, as a common global function namespace is
expected, the responsibility of not hiding it within a local
environment should be placed exactly upon these local environment
definitions and not on the macro definitions.
</p>

<p>
In consequence, local function definitions would have to make sure
their names don't clash with any global function definition, so these
local functions could be only addressed from expressions lexically
within the local environment, but not from macro expansions.
</p>

<p>
This idea can be implemented by a macro using <code>gensym</code> for local
function names, quite similar to the way local variable names within
macros are generated. Now, in each place a local function is
addressed within the environment, it must be replaced by the
corresponding symbol generated, but before macro expansion takes
place. Otherwise, it would also modify the macro expansion, which we
don't want to happen here.
</p>

<p>
The macro <code>local-flet</code> uses a function code-walking the given
body, doing this replacement. Fortunately, given the definition of a
separate function namespace, function names can only appear in exactly
two situations: in the function position of expressions, or being
sharp-quoted; that is as argument to the <code>function</code> function.
Unfortunately, code-walking isn't that easy, so this works only in
simple cases.
The
macro expects the same arguments as <code>cl-flet</code> and creates a local
function namespace not visible to macro expansions within.

         ,@(<span class="org-keyword">cl-loop</span> for expr in body collect
                    (lf--replace-local-functions fncsyms expr))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using this, the function definition from the example above can be
modified as follows, resolving the issue without any need to modify the
macro:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="org7cda22c">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (x y) `(cons 'foo (cons ,x (cons ,y nil))))

(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span> (x y)
  (local-flet ((cons (x y) (cons y x)))
    (foo x y)))

(baz 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">(foo 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And, demonstrating simultaneous application of the local function and
the macro expansion shows that it works lexically:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="org84c8c5f">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span> (x y)
  (local-flet ((cons (x y) (cons y x)))
    (cons 0 (foo x (funcall #'cons 3 y)))))

(baz 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">((foo 1 (2 . 3)) . 0)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And now, if you additionally choose to replace the
global definition of <code>cons</code> using a dynamic approach like <code>cl-letf</code>,
as expected this affects the global environment and macro expansions,
but leaves the local definition.
So while not being respected by the solution modifying the macro to
contain the fixed function object, it is respected by the solution
shown here.
</p>

<p>
In a similar way, a <code>local-labels</code> macro should be devised. But there,
the local function definitions, possibly having recursive
definitions, would also be subject to the replacement.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org76058a8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org76058a8">Defining detached value namespaces for macros</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org76058a8">
<p>
In a similar way, a macro can be used creating a local value namespace
within macro expansions, this way avoiding interference with the
environment a macro is expanded into. It is an extension of the
<code>with-gensyms</code> macro often found. The syntax of <code>with-macro-namespace</code>
is similar to that of <code>let</code>, naming a list of variables either
uninitialized or bound to the value of an expression. These variable
names can be used safely and "un-unquoted" within the macro
definition.
</p>

<p>
The macro works by building a quoted expression (which generates the
s-exp to be used as macro expansion), but unquoting all references to
the variables of the detached namespace. It is done by expanding each
quoted list into a list expression whose elements are quoted. If an
element is part of the detached namespace, it is not quoted, this way
effectively unquoting it.
</p>

<p>
It then expands to an expression where the variables are defined and
initialized as gensyms, then putting in the quoted s-exp previously built.
So at the end, it automates what is typically done when writing
macros&#x2014;after all, that's what macros are made for, arent they?

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd46ae71">
<p>
In conclusion, function names should be considered (globally) visible
to arbitrary code and therefore must be unique, even when defined
within local environments. Macros addressing a function cannot expect
it to be replaced by a different local function. This can be
guaranteed by using local function namespaces. On the other side,
lexical variable names can only be used within their lexical
environment. So here macro expansions must make sure not interfere
with them, which again can be guaranteed using local value namespaces.
</p>

<p>
As long as these two points are respected, the separate function
namespace can actually help make macros work as expected.

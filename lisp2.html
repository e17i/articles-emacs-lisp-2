Trying to understand why there are different namespaces for functions
and values in Lisp<sub>2</sub>, I was diving into that a little bit. The notes
taken and macros written on that way are shown here. Providing local
namespaces for the development of further macros, they can help to
prevent unwanted free name capture.

<h2 id="org72c9283">Macro expansion and local functions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org72c9283">
<p>
When diving into that topic, you eventually stumble upon <i>Technical
Issues of Separation in Function Cells and Value Cells</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.
According to that paper, among others a prime reason for two separate
namespaces is the existence of macros, as expressed in the well known
citation taken from there: "a single namespace is of fundamental
importance, and therefore macros are problematic [&#x2026; but] macros are
fundamental, and therefore a single namespace is problematic".
</p>

<p>
So which problem with macros is solved by applying different
namespaces? When accidentally naming a local variable the same as a
global function, with a single namespace this would hide the global
function. While not being encouraged at all, name clashes could be
resolved within a local environment without refactoring the variable
names. For example, if the function was not addressed within the
environment, the fact that it is hidden wouldn't be a problem at al.
But this would work only as long as no macros are used. Because macros
can expand arbitrary code into the environment, the prerequisite given
above could not be checked.
</p>

<p>
To solve this problem of name collisions in macro expansions, the
following aspects need to be handled. For variable names of
let-environments within the macro expansion, it is typically handled
by creating uninterned anonymouns symbols (by means of <code>gensym</code>)
replacing their value symbols. This way, for variables, effectively a
local namespace is created only visible within the macro expansion.
Next, local variable names of the outer environment a macro expansion
is inserted into can't be addressed from within the macro expansion as
long as they can't be known in the macro definition. So addressing an
arbitrary value symbol from within macro expansion would be an error,
if that name was not communicated somehow.
</p>

<p>
Stays the question of function names being addressed from within the
macro expansion. Here, in accordance to the previous statement, the
set of global functions can be seen as being communicated. So macros
should expect being able to address global function names regardless
of the local environment they are expanded into. To make this work,
the problem mentioned above would be mitigated by using a common
function namespace shared between the place the macro is defined in
and environments it is expanded into. Given that, macros could expect
function names addressed in their definition to be valid also in the
places they are expanded into.
</p>

<p>
But in the paper mentioned above, an example is given also
showing name collisions in function namespace. It is repeated
here, slightly adopted to emacs lisp:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="org91463f4">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (x y) `(cons 'foo (cons ,x (cons ,y nil))))

(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span> (x y)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cl-flet</span> ((cons (x y) (cons y x)))
    (foo x y)))

(baz 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Which results in an output probably not intended by the macro author:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">(((nil . 2) . 1) . foo)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This could be solved within the macro by replacing the function symbol
<code>cons</code> by it's function object valid when the macro was defined instead
of resolving it in the place of it's expansion:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="org4f0dbfe">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (x y)
  `(funcall ,(symbol-function 'cons) 'foo
            (funcall ,(symbol-function 'cons) ,x
                     (funcall ,(symbol-function 'cons) ,y nil))))

(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span> (x y)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cl-flet</span> ((cons (x y) (cons y x)))
    (foo x y)))

(baz 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Which now gives the result probably intended:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">(foo 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But now, the <code>funcall</code> function name is still subject to possible free
name capture.
The paper's section concludes: "With the advent of FLET, LABELS, and
MACROLET, the risk of conflict is considerably higher".
</p>

<p>
What's done manually in this example to solve that conflict is quite
similar to the solution used by hygienic macros. It involves resolving
free symbols from within a macro expansion using the lexical context
of the corresponding macro definition. But maybe this was not at all
intended by the macro. After all, it is a valid use case to globally
replace the implementation of certain functions at runtime, which then
actually should be respected not only globally, but also by macro
expansions.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Let over Lambda</i><sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>, Hoyte concludes, "Hygienic macros are, in
the best of situations, a beginner's safety guard-rail; in the worst
of situations they form an electric fence, trapping their victims in a
sanitised, capture-safe prison".
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbdf6565" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbdf6565">Creating a local function namespace</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbdf6565">
<p>
The considerations shown above give a strong hint that a common global function
namespace is expected to exist, having the properties of being shared
between all global parts of a running system and still being
dynamically modifyable (within boundaries) while staying in a
consistent state.
</p>

<p>
So an alternate approach would be not to fix the problem within the
macro definition, but instead in the place the macro is expanded into.
As local variable names are expected to not being hidden by macro
expansions&#x2014;and consequently, pushing the responsibility of not doing
that into the definition of macros, the same could also be done for
local function names. But here, as a common global function namespace
is expected, the responsibility of not hiding it within a local
environment should be placed exactly upon these local environment
definitions and not be pushed to the macro definitions.
</p>

<p>
In consequence, local function definitions would have to make sure
their names don't clash with any global function definition, so these
local functions could be only addressed from expressions located
lexically within the local environment, but not from macros expanded
into that place.
</p>

<p>
This idea can't be implemented as a macro, as this would involve code
walking prior to macro expansion. But to implement a reliable code
walking function, prerequisite is to bring the syntax tree serving as
input into a normal form, where each expression is a list consisting
of a symbol or a lambda expression in first position and symbols or
normalized expressions in all further positions. So, for example
let-constructs would be replaced by lambda calls, macro applications
introducing different syntax would be expanded. Given this it is clear
there is no normal form and, consequently, no reliable code walking
without macro expansion. On the other side, with macros expanded
already, the function calls that should not be addressing local
function definitions are already in place. And then, after macro
expansion, there is no distinction between function calls resulting
from macro expansion and function calls subject to local function
definitions. Nevertheless, the following experiment can illustrate
what to do manually to avoid name clashes when using local functions.
</p>

<p>
In each place a local function is addressed within the environment, it
would be replaced by a unique symbol, but before macro expansion takes
place. Otherwise, it would also modify the macro expansion, which we
don't want to happen here.
</p>

<p>
The macro <code>local-flet</code> uses a function code-walking the given body,
doing this replacement. Fortunately, given the definition of a
separate function namespace, function names can only appear in exactly
two situations: in the function position of expressions, or being
sharp-quoted; that is as argument to the <code>function</code> function.
Unfortunately, as shown above, actually code-walking isn't that easy,
so this works only in simple cases.
</p>

<p>
The macro expects the same arguments as <code>cl-flet</code> and creates a local
function namespace not visible to macro expansions within.

                                               (value value))))
      `(<span class="org-keyword">cl-flet</span> ,(<span class="org-keyword">cl-loop</span> for (name . expr) in fdefs collect

         ,@(<span class="org-keyword">cl-loop</span> for expr in body collect
                    (local/replace-local-functions fncsyms expr))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using this, the function definition from the example above could be
modified as follows, resolving the issue without any need to modify the
macro:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="orgbe82e16">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (x y) `(cons 'foo (cons ,x (cons ,y nil))))

(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span> (x y)
  (local-flet ((cons (x y) (cons y x)))
    (foo x y)))

(baz 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">(foo 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And, demonstrating simultaneous application of the local function and
the macro expansion shows that it works lexically:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="org56e680e">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">baz</span> (x y)
  (local-flet ((cons (x y) (cons y x)))
    (cons 0 (foo x (funcall #'cons '(cons 3 4) y)))))

(baz 1 2)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org">((foo 1 (2 cons 3 4)) . 0)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, if you additionally choose to replace the
global definition of <code>cons</code> using a dynamic approach like <code>cl-letf</code>,
as expected this affects the global environment and macro expansions,
but leaves the local definition.
</p>

<p>
In a similar way, a <code>local-labels</code> macro would be devised. But there,
the local function definitions, possibly having recursive
definitions, would also be subject to the replacement.
</p>

<p>
But as code-walking without prior macro expansion cannot work
reliably, this stays an idea. In real life, it can be taken as a hint
to use unique names also for local functions. So it seems to be a good
idea to use same the naming conventions as those used for global
functions in emacs lisp, prepending function names with a package
name, in a similar way also for local function definitions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb260e97" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb260e97">Defining detached value namespaces for macros</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb260e97">
<p>
In a similar way, a macro can be used to create a local value namespace
within macro expansions, this way avoiding interference with the
environment a macro is expanded into. The macro shown here is an extension of the
<code>with-gensyms</code> macro<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. The syntax of that macro,
<code>with-macro-namespace</code>, is similar, just naming a list of value symbols. These
symbol names can then be used safely and "un-unquoted" within the
actual macro definition.
</p>

<p>
This is similar to the idea of <i>metatronic macros</i><sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>. But there, the
value symbols used within macro expansion are enclosed within special syntax.
This seems to be unnecessary, as the names to be handled this way are
already declared.
</p>

<p>
The macro works by building a quoted expression (which generates the
s-exp to be used as macro expansion), but then unquoting all
references to the value symbol names of the detached namespace. It is
done by expanding each quoted list into a list expression whose
elements are quoted. If an element is declared to be part of the
detached namespace, instead it is not quoted, this way effectively and
implicitely unquoting it.
</p>

<p>
It then expands to an expression where the variables are defined and
initialized as gensyms, then putting in the quoted s-exp previously built.
So at the end, it automates what is typically done when writing
macros&#x2014;after all, that's what macros are made for, arent they?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">provide</span> '<span class="org-constant">macro-namespace</span>)

                                                   ((eq (car arg) 'outer) `(,',pquote ,(cadr arg)))
                                                   (`(list ,@(mapcar (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (elem) `(<span class="org-keyword">quote</span> ,elem))

           ,qbody)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So instead of writing (just for the sake of an example):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (expr)
  (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((val (gensym)))
    `(<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((,val ,expr))
       (1+ ,val))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
you would juse use this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="org673956d">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (expr)
  (with-macro-namespace (val)
    `(<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((val ,expr))
       (1+ val))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
expanding to
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defmacro</span> <span class="org-function-name">foo</span> (expr)
  (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((val (gensym <span class="org-string">"val"</span>)))
    (cons 'let
          (cons
           (list
            (list val expr))
           (list
            (list '1+ val))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and be fine.
</p>

<p>
If a variable of an outer namespace having the same name as a variable
of the local macro namespace is to be addressed from within the
expansion, this can be done with the <code>outer</code> form. This works in a way
similar to using <code>function</code>, explicitely addressing names of the
function namespace from within value namespace. Here, it just
translates <code>(outer val)</code> to a quoted symbol <code>'val</code> (actually just
leaving it being quoted), so it can also be used when addressing
arbitrary symbols not defined in the local namespace without any harm.
It just makes sure that the unquoting mechanism for local value symbol
names is overridden. At the end, this macro gives a fine-grained and
explicit control for avoiding and adressing symbols from an
environment a macro is expanded into.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org780f9c6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org780f9c6">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org780f9c6">
<p>
In conclusion, all function names should be considered (somehow globally) visible
to arbitrary code and therefore must be unique, even when defined
within local environments. Macros addressing a function cannot expect
them to be hidden by local function definitions. A solution to this could use an
approach similar to that of implementing package namespaces, which
also aim to prevent name clashes between globally visible function
names.
</p>

<p>
On the other side, lexical variable names can only be used within
their lexical environment. So here it's up to the macro expansions to
make sure not to interfere with them. This can be addressed using
local variable namespaces.
</p>

<p>
As long as these two points are respected, the separate function
namespace helping to prevent hiding global functions within local
value environments can serve as another building block to make macros
work as expected.
